# Keyword-Based Auto-Acknowledgment for Assys-Montagehelfer

This extension adds voice control to the Assys-Montagehelfer system, allowing you to navigate through assembly steps using specific keyword commands. You can move both forward and backward through the assembly process.

## Features

- Hands-free navigation through assembly steps using simple keywords
- Recognizes commands in both German and English
- Works alongside the existing camera-based auto-acknowledge system
- Customizable wake words and sensitivity settings
- No need for user to interact with the interface physically

## Usage

1. Make sure your system has a microphone connected and properly configured
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install SpeechRecognition requests pyaudio
   ```
   Note: `pyaudio` may require additional system libraries. On Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev
   ```

3. Start the keyword recognition service:
   ```
   ./start_keyword_control.sh
   ```

4. Begin your assembly process in the web application
5. When you want to move to the next step, say one of the forward navigation words:
   - "next"
   - "weiter"
   - "continue"
   - "nächste"
   - "fertig"
   - "ok"

6. When you want to go back to the previous step, say one of the backward navigation words:
   - "back"
   - "zurück"
   - "previous"
   - "vorherige"
   - "rückgängig"
   - "undo"

## Configuration

You can customize the keyword recognition behavior using environment variables:

- `ASSYS_SERVER_URL`: The URL of your Assys-Montagehelfer server
  ```
  export ASSYS_SERVER_URL="http://192.168.178.130:5000"
  ```

- `SPEECH_ENERGY_THRESHOLD`: Sensitivity for speech detection (default: 3000)
  ```
  export SPEECH_ENERGY_THRESHOLD=4000
  ```

- `SPEECH_PAUSE_THRESHOLD`: How long to wait for a pause before processing (default: 0.8)
  ```
  export SPEECH_PAUSE_THRESHOLD=1.0
  ```

- `SPEECH_COOLDOWN`: Time to wait between acknowledgments (default: 2.0)
  ```
  export SPEECH_COOLDOWN=1.5
  ```

- `SPEECH_NEXT_WORDS`: Comma-separated list of custom forward navigation words
  ```
  export SPEECH_NEXT_WORDS="next,proceed,advance,forward"
  ```

- `SPEECH_BACK_WORDS`: Comma-separated list of custom backward navigation words
  ```
  export SPEECH_BACK_WORDS="back,previous,return,undo"
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Service doesn't respond to keywords**: 
  - Try adjusting the `SPEECH_ENERGY_THRESHOLD` value. Lower values increase sensitivity.
  - Make sure your microphone is working by testing it with another application.

- **Service keeps acknowledging ambient speech**:
  - Increase the `SPEECH_ENERGY_THRESHOLD` value.
  - Increase the `SPEECH_COOLDOWN` period.
  - Use more specific wake words that aren't likely to appear in normal conversation.

- **"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service"**:
  - Check your internet connection.
  - Google's speech recognition service has usage limits. Consider switching to an offline recognition engine if this happens frequently.

## Technical Details

The keyword recognition runs as a separate process from the main application. When it detects a navigation word, it sends an HTTP request to the `/auto_acknowledge` endpoint of the Assys-Montagehelfer server with the appropriate direction (forward or backward), which then automatically navigates to the next or previous step, just as if the user had clicked the corresponding button.

## Comparison with Camera-Based Auto-Acknowledgment

While the camera-based system requires specific hand gestures to be shown to the camera, the keyword-based system listens for specific words. This provides an alternative method for hands-free operation, particularly useful when:

- The user's hands are occupied with assembly tasks
- The working environment makes camera recognition difficult
- Users prefer voice commands over gestures
- A camera is not available or cannot be positioned appropriately

Both systems can be used simultaneously to provide maximum flexibility.
